<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Ut Video Codec Suite is a lossless video codec for Windows, which is implemented as a VCM codec (also called "VfW codec").
It can currently encode YUV422 sources.</p>

<h2 id="implementation_goal">Implementation goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Realtime high definition capture with Core 2 Duo class CPU</li>
<li>Better compression ratio than Huffyuv</li>
<li>Near compression ratio as Lagarith, if possible</li>
</ul>
<h3>Achievement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Far from realtime high definition capture because written in C++ only and not optimized well.</li>
<li>Usually better compression ratio than Huffyuv (Predict median) for progressive sources.</li>
<li>May worse compression ratio than Huffyuv for interlace sources whose height is greater than 288 pixels.</li>
<li>Usually worse compression ratio than Lagarith, but rarely better.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 2.0.0</h3>
